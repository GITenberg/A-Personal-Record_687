description: "A Personal Record is an autobiographical work (or \"fragment of biography\"\
  ) by Joseph Conrad, published in 1912.\nIt has also been published under the titles\
  \ A Personal Record: Some Reminiscences and Some Reminiscences.\nNotoriously unreliable\
  \ and digressive in structure, it is nonetheless the principal contemporary source\
  \ for information about the author's life. It tells about his schooling in Russian\
  \ Poland, his sailing in Marseille, the influence of his Uncle Tadeusz, and the\
  \ writing of Almayer's Folly.\nIt provides a glimpse of how Conrad wished to be\
  \ seen by his British public, as well as being an atmospheric work of art.\nThe\
  \ \"Familiar Preface\" Conrad wrote for it includes the often quoted lines:\n\"\
  Those who read me know my conviction that the world, the temporal world, rests on\
  \ a few very simple ideas; so simple that they must be as old as the hills. It rests\
  \ notably, among others, on the idea of Fidelity.\"\nConrad wrote a new 'Author's\
  \ Note' to A Personal Record for the Doubleday collected edition of his works (published\
  \ in 1920) in which he discussed his friendship with the British colonial official\
  \ and writer Hugh Clifford.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
